My phase 3 project required a front end to interact with an API I created.
This is a glossary of players, their sports refence pages, and their nicknames
I used basketball reference, baseball reference, and wikipedia for the links and nicknames.
This was separated into 4 form components, adding a player, adding a nickname, editing a nickname, and deleting a nickname
I also added a filter to find players easier.
